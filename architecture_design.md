# BlenderMCP Ultimate Cinematic Upgrade - Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for upgrading BlenderMCP into an AI-driven cinematic tool in Blender. The upgrade will enable users to create high-quality, short sequences through simple text prompts, handling scene setup, animation, physics, rendering, and post-processing automatically.

## Current Architecture Analysis

The current BlenderMCP is a Blender addon that connects Blender to Claude via MCP (Model Control Protocol). Key components include:

1. **BlenderMCPServer**: Handles socket communication
2. **Command Execution System**: Processes commands from Claude
3. **Basic Object Manipulation**: Functions for creating, modifying, and deleting objects
4. **External Service Integration**: PolyHaven for assets and Hyper3D for generation

## Proposed Architecture

The upgraded architecture will maintain compatibility with the existing codebase while adding new modules for cinematic capabilities:
